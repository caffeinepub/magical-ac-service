# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the landing page to be fully text-based and update the Service Areas content to the new approved list.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Our Work” section from the landing page, including any headings, links, or scroll/navigation targets that reference it.
- Remove all service-related images and decorative iconography across the landing page (e.g., gallery/work images, service-card icons, location-pin emojis/icons, and decorative icons in CTAs), keeping CTAs functional as text-only.
- Update the Service Areas section to list exactly: Hanspura, Shahibaug, New Shahibaug, Nana Chiloda, Nikol, Naroda, Bapunagar, Odhav, Satellite, Prahladnagar, Bopal, Gota, Science City, and Gandhinagar (All Sectors).
- Update any coverage/summary text that mentions service locations so it aligns with the updated Service Areas list and does not reference removed locations.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page displays a simplified, text-only experience with no “Our Work” section, no service images/icons, and an updated Service Areas list and related coverage text matching the specified locations.
