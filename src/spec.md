# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the React landing page’s nav/hero styling to match the provided HTML design and translate all remaining Gujarati UI text to English.

**Planned changes:**
- Restyle the top navigation to match the provided snippet: sticky white bar with shadow, bold/underlined/italic brand title, and an orange “Book Now” button.
- Update the hero section to use the specified blue diagonal gradient background (linear-gradient 135deg from #1e3a8a to #3b82f6) with centered heading and CTA buttons.
- Ensure hero CTA buttons continue to link to WhatsApp (wa.me) and phone (tel:) using the existing number 8000262644.
- Replace all remaining Gujarati user-facing text across landing sections (including hero tagline and Services section heading/descriptions) with clear English equivalents preserving the meaning.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page displays the updated nav and gradient hero design, and all visible text is in English with working WhatsApp/phone CTAs to 8000262644.
