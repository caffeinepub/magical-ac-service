# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the landing page Services section to match the provided 4-card layout/styling and ensure all user-facing content is in English.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/components/landing/ServicesSection.tsx` to use a white section background, centered underlined English heading, and a responsive 1/2/4-column card grid matching the provided styling (light-blue card background, rounded corners, bottom border accent, shadow).
- Replace Gujarati descriptions with English translations while keeping the four service titles exactly: Jet Wash Service, Expert Repairing, Gas Refilling, Installation.
- Replace Font Awesome-based icons with non-Font Awesome icons that still represent snowflake, tools, gas pump, and box/open package, keeping similar size and blue color.

**User-visible outcome:** The Services section displays a clean, white-background section with a centered underlined English heading and four consistently styled service cards in a responsive grid, each showing a blue icon, the required title, and an English description.
