  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all requirements addressing the blank draft tab issue. Component exports/imports are verified through App.tsx and LandingPage.tsx changes, Google Fonts and structured data are present in index.html, and extensive styling updates with glassmorphism effects and Tailwind animations are implemented across multiple components. All four requirements appear to be fully addressed.",
