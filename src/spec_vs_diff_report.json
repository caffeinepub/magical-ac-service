  "summary": "Landing page composition was simplified by removing the Our Work section from the rendered LandingPage, and the Service Areas + Coverage text were updated to the specified 14 locations. Services cards and CTAs appear text-only, but decorative iconography/images still exist in the codebase (footer Heart icon and the OurWorkSection gallery component).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove all service images and decorative iconography so the website is simple and text-based (no <img> in service-related sections; no service-card icons; no emoji/icon prefixes in Service Areas; CTAs text-only).",
      "reason": "The diff shows remaining decorative iconography in the footer (lucide-react Heart icon). Also the OurWorkSection component is still present and described as a gallery with images, which conflicts with the \"no <img>\" acceptance criterion for gallery/work examples (even if not rendered).",
