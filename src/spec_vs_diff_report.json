  "summary": "The Service Areas section component is implemented with the required responsive 8-card grid, English headline/footnote, and orange/blue accent grouping. However, the diff also introduces unrequested backend and Internet Identity/auth + actor/query infrastructure, which conflicts with stated non-goals.",

    {
      "description": "Added Internet Identity authentication context/provider and related login/identity management hooks, despite non-goal explicitly disallowing Internet Identity auth.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals include \"Adding Internet Identity authentication\"; diff introduces InternetIdentityProvider and useInternetIdentity hook and wires it into the app root.",
