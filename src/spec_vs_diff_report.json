  "summary": "The diff implements partial fixes for the blank page issue, focusing on error handling and initialization improvements in the LanguageProvider and OurWorkSection. However, critical diagnostic requirements (REQ-3, REQ-4) lack concrete implementation evidence, and the changes do not include comprehensive console error checking, React initialization verification, or systematic asset loading validation as specified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Check for JavaScript errors or console warnings that might prevent React application initialization",
      "reason": "No evidence of systematic error boundary implementation, React root mount verification, Internet Identity provider initialization checks, or React Query client initialization validation. The diff only shows console.log/warn/error calls in LanguageProvider and OurWorkSection, but does not implement comprehensive error checking for React initialization failures.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure the HTML entry point (frontend/index.html) correctly references the main JavaScript bundle and root div element",
      "reason": "While frontend/index.html shows the root div and script tag exist, there is no evidence of validation logic to verify these references are correct or to detect/prevent conflicting scripts. The AC requires 'no conflicting scripts or styles blocking React initialization' but the diff shows no mechanism to detect or prevent such conflicts.",

    {
      "description": "Image error handling with fallback UI in OurWorkSection",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest scope is limited to diagnosing and fixing the blank page issue with focus on asset loading verification (REQ-2). While the onError handler helps with image debugging, the elaborate inline HTML fallback UI rendering was not requested and goes beyond simple verification of assets loading correctly.",

        "frontend/src/components/landing/OurWorkSection.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Delayed rendering logic in LanguageProvider with isInitialized state",
      "reason": "The LanguageProvider now includes logic to prevent rendering children until initialized (returns null before initialization). This loading state management was not requested in any requirement. REQ-1 requires the page to load and display content, but this implementation could potentially cause additional blank page scenarios if initialization fails.",
