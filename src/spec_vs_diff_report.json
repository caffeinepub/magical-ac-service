  "summary": "The diff adds a new `OurWorkSection` component and inserts it into `LandingPage` between `ServicesSection` and `CoverageSection`. The section renders a responsive 1/2/3-column image-card grid with heading/subtitle, hover shadow, and image zoom. No changes are shown under `frontend/src/components/ui` and no backend changes are included.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Frontend must compose shadcn/ui components (without editing sources under `frontend/src/components/ui`). The new gallery section is implemented with plain HTML elements (`div`, `img`) rather than shadcn/ui components, so this constraint does not appear to be met.",
      "reason": "`OurWorkSection` uses only standard elements and Tailwind classes; no shadcn/ui components are imported/used in the new section per the diff summary.",
