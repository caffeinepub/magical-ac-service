REQ-2 is partially evidenced (Services section and hero tagline are English), but the diff does not provide enough evidence to confirm that *all* remaining Gujarati text across the entire landing page UI has been translated.",

      "reason": "Only HeroSection and ServicesSection text changes are visible in the diff. Other landing page sections/components (e.g., coverage, booking, footer, gallery, service areas) are not shown as modified here, so it cannot be confirmed from the diff summary that Gujarati text was removed everywhere.",
